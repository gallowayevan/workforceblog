* Growth of the nurse practitioner (NP) and physician assistant (PA) workforce has outpaced that of the state's physician workforce.
* NP and PA programs are shorter in duration (typically two years) than medical school (typically four years), NPs and PAs are not required to complete residency education for licensure, and many new NP and PA schools have opened in NC since 2000.
