* Over the past decade, the number of residency positions in NC has grown.

* Compared to non-AHEC NC residency graduates, a higher percentage of NC AHEC residency grads are practicing in NC.  This is particularly true for Family Medicine.  (See our [previous blog post](https://nchealthworkforce.unc.edu/ahec_resident_outcomes_2017/))
* In the cohort study of NC GME grads from 2008-2011, some GME specialties had better in-state retention rates five-years after graduation than other specialties did.  Graduates from Psychiatry, Internal Medicine-Pediatrics, and Family Medicine were retained at higher rates.

* Some GME programs that had high rates of retention in NC five years after graduation in the cohort study (see [Appendix, Table 3](https://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/workforce_product/workforce-outcomes-nc-physician-residency-graduates/) for data).  Success stories include:
  * MAHEC-Asheville Family Medicine Residency: 74% (n=23/31)
  * Carolinas Medical Center Family Medicine Residency: 71% (n=22/31)
  * UNC Hospitals Psychiatry Residency: 69% (n=33/48)
  * Wake Forest School of Medicine Psychiatry Residency: 69% (n=9/13)
  * Carolinas HealthCare System Northeast (Cabarrus) Family Medicine Residency: 66% (n=19/29)
  * Cone Health Family Medicine Residency: 66% (n=21/32)
  * Cone Health Internal Medicine Residency: 66% (n=19/29)
* There is a high concentration of family medicine physicians per capita in Western NC relative to the rest of the state.  There are multiple reasons for this, but the MAHEC Family Medicine residency program is likely a factor.
