* NC has moved up in the national rankings of dentists per capita, from 44th in 2013 to 37th in 2017.
* The majority of the dentist growth in the state occurred in the few counties already well-supplied with dentists, while the supply of dentists relative to population in rural and underserved counties remained largely unchanged.
