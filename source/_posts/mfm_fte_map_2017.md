* Maternal and fetal medicine is a subspecialty of Obstetrics and Gynecology (Ob-Gyn) focused on high-risk or complicated pregnancies.
* As with many subspecialties, maternal and fetal medicine physicians tend to concentrate in metropolitan areas, near hospitals and academic health centers. However, they frequently expand the reach of their services through telemedicine services and consultations with a patient's primary Ob-Gyn.
