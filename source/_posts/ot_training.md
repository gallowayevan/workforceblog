* 37% of NC occupational therapists (OTs) were trained in state.
* Looking at just the number of occupational therapists trained in each state, we see that New York, Pennsylvania, and Florida train the greatest number of NC OTs. However, these are also the third, fourth, and fifth most populous states.

* If we normalize by the general population in each state, we can see that our neighbors are relatively big contributors to the number of OTs in NC, as is Maine! Although it's not easily visible on the map, Washington, D.C. is a big outlier, though this is somewhat misleading, because the population of Washington, D.C. doesn't reflect the size and density of the Washington Metro Area.

* Looking within North Carolina, East Carolina University is the school where most of the OTs in NC were trained. Four of the five OT schools in NC are represented in this chart. Cabarrus College of Health Sciences [only started graduating OTs in 2016](https://atriumhealth.org/education/cabarrus-college-of-health-sciences/academic-programs/occupational-therapy). In contrast, [ECU graduated its first class in 1974](http://www.ecu.edu/cs-dhs/ot/program.cfm).
