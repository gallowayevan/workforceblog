* Occupational therapists (OTs) treat patients with physical, developmental, or cognitive disabilities, focusing on the patient's ability to perform activities for daily life. OTs work with patients in homes, schools, workplaces, and healthcare facilities. 
* A master's degree is the current entry degree for OTs, though some OTs are pushing to require a doctoral degree. North Carolina does not have a doctoral OT program and fewer than 100 of the OTs in NC are doctorally trained. But six schools are pursuing accredditation for a doctoral program. (See [here](https://www.aota.org/Education-Careers/Find-School/Developing/OTD-Developing.aspx) and [here](https://www.aota.org/Education-Careers/Find-School/Applicant/OTD-Applicant.aspx).) Four of these six would be new OT programs.
* 1,269 (37%) of NC occupational therapists (OTs) were trained in state.
* Four of the five OT schools in NC are represented in this chart. Cabarrus College of Health Sciences [graduated its first class of OTs in 2016](https://atriumhealth.org/education/cabarrus-college-of-health-sciences/academic-programs/occupational-therapy).

* Most OTs are trained outside of NC. After NC, New York, Pennsylvania, and Florida are the top contrbutors to NC's OT workforce. (Of course, these are also the third, fourth, and fifth most populous states.)
