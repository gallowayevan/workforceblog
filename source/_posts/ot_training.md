* Occupational therapists (OTs) treat patients with physical, developmental, or cognitive disabilities, focusing on the patient's ability to perform activities for daily life. OTs work with patients in homes, schools, workplaces, and healthcare facilities. 
* A master's degree is required for OT to become licensed. National OT organizations have considered requiring a [doctoral degree](https://www.aota.org/Education-Careers/Accreditation/acote-doctoral-mandate-2027.aspx). 
  * North Carolina does not have a doctoral OT program and fewer than 100 of the OTs in NC are doctorally trained. Six NC schools are pursuing accreditation for a doctoral program. (See [here](https://www.aota.org/Education-Careers/Find-School/Developing/OTD-Developing.aspx) and [here](https://www.aota.org/Education-Careers/Find-School/Applicant/OTD-Applicant.aspx).) Four of these six would be new OT programs.
* In 2018, 1,269 (37%) of NC occupational therapists (OTs) were trained in state.
* NC has five OT schools, four of which are represented in the below chart. Cabarrus College of Health Sciences [graduated its first class of OTs in 2016](https://atriumhealth.org/education/cabarrus-college-of-health-sciences/academic-programs/occupational-therapy).

* Most OTs are trained outside of NC. After NC, New York, Pennsylvania, and Florida are the top contrbutors to NC's OT workforce. (These are also the third, fourth, and fifth most populous states in the U.S.)![](/images/posts/training_map_counts.png)
