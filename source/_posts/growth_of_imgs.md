* International Medical Graduates (IMGs) are physicians who received their medical education outside of the United States, Puerto Rico, or Canada. As of 2018, 15.5% of North Carolina physicians are IMGs. This is below the [state median of 19.1%](https://www.aamc.org/data/workforce/reports/484392/2017-state-physician-workforce-data-report.html).
* The number of IMGs in North Carolina has more than doubled since 2000, and the number educated in the Caribbean has quintupled. Most of the physicians educated in the Caribbean are United States citizens.
* India is the largest source of IMGs for North Carolina.

* Different physician areas of practice have different proportions of IMGs. In 2018, IMGs comprised 43% of the hospitalists in North Carolina, but only made up 12% of the family medicine physician workforce.
* 30% of North Carolina IMGs practice in primary care, which is nearly the same percentage as graduates of US medical schools (29%). This contrasts with national data implying that IMGs are more likely to enter primacy care practice.
