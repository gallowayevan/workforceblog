* In North Carolina, infant mortality rates are higher for non-Hispanic black babies than for non-Hispanic white babies, and this gap has persisted for nearly 20 years. (1) In 2018, black infants were 2.44 times more likely to die than white infants. (2, 3) 
* Relative to white patients, black patients report worse communication and lower shared decision-making with physicians. (4) Racial concordance, when patients and physicians identify as the same race, is associated with better patient-physician communication.
* In 2018, 21% of NC's population identified as black or African American, compared to 13% of the state's obstetric delivery providers.
* Only five black family medicine physicians reported providing routine obstetric delivery services in 2018.
