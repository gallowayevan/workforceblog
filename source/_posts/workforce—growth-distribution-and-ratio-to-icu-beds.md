* As North Carolina prepares for a rising number of COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization, [@WorkforceNC](https://twitter.com/WorkforceNC) is committed to providing data on the availability of critically needed health professionals.  
* [NPR recently reported](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818192507/are-there-enough-skilled-medical-workers-to-run-ventilators) that 2% of those who contract the coronavirus develop respiratory issues that require a ventilator.  In addition to concerns about [a shortage of ventilators](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/business/coronavirus-ventilator-shortage.html), North Carolina needs the skilled medical workforce required to operate ventilators across the state.
* Respiratory therapists (RTs) are associate-degree-educated health professionals who often work in hospital intensive care units (ICUs) and operate and manage ventilator use. As of 2019, North Carolina had 4,318 RTs, 66% of whom were educated in NC. Since 2014 there has been little overall growth of our state’s RT workforce, which has only increased by 2.8% over the past 6 years. 
* The RT workforce is concentrated in metropolitan areas with large academic health centers.

* Since 2004, the gap between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan (rural) rates of RTs per 10,000 population has continued to grow; in 2019, the metro rate was 22% higher than the nonmetro rate.

* Below, we mapped RTs per Intensive Care Unit (ICU) bed in North Carolina. Our definition of ICU beds includes coronary care unit and surgical ICU beds. While many counties have no ICU beds and/or no RTs, some counties have a low ratio of RTs to ICU beds. Nine counties have an RT: ICU bed ratio of less than one—Polk, Craven, McDowell, Cleveland, Moore, Durham, Alamance, Pitt and Buncombe.
